Recognize Python decimal integer literals (section 2.4.4 - 2.4.5)
For simplicity, you can assume the input string s length <=20.
Your program should ask for user input as a string, and check if it can be a valid decimal integer or not.
You also need to include your NFA design (with unlimited digits allowed
you can break this into a few smaller NFA's so it's not one humongous machine) drawn using JFlapLinks to an external site.. (Please submit the .jff files.)
